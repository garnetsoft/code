# coding practice 

1. Standardizing code formatting

2. Don't follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle blindly

3. Debug code via logs

4. Beware of premature optizations 

5. Don't complicate your codebase with unnecessary features

6. Setup a CI/CD pipeline early in the development lifecycle
